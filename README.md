## 🌿 What I Explore  
- React.js – building dynamic, interactive UIs  
- TypeScript – type-safe, maintainable code  
- Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling for fast, responsive design  
- API Integration – RESTful and third-party APIs  
- Accessibility & Inclusive Design – building for all users  
- Component-based Design Systems – reusable, scalable UI components  
- Testing – Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright for robust, reliable code.
