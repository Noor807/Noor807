### About me
-Hello! Iâ€™m Noor ul Huda Irfan, a passionate learner and creativethinker with a diverse educational background.
 At 33 years old, I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Botany, Zoology,and Psychology,which has given me a unique perspective
 on the world and the interconnectedness of life.

-ðŸŒ±Currently, I am diving into the world of technology, pursuin a two-year program in Frontend Development at
 Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
 My journey into web design is driven by a fascination with how technology can enhance our experiences and interactions online.

With a keen eye for aesthetics and usability, I aim to create engaging and accessible web experiences that resonate
with users. I thrive on exploring new design trends and technologies,continually honing my skills to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.

 When Iâ€™m not coding or designing, you can find me in exploring nature, designing something on figma, delving into the intricacies of human behavior,or experimenting with creative projects. I believe that my diverse background  fuels my creativityand problem-solving abilities, 
allowing me to approach web design with a unique lens.
